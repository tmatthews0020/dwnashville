  <h1> Solid Surface Countertops</h1>
  <p> Design Works now carries Corian&reg; Solid Surface Countertops </p>
  <p> Solid surface countertops are non-porous, so stains cannot penetrate their surface. They also resist the growth of mold, mildew and bacteria.
     The seamless look of integrated kitchen countertops, sinks, and coved backsplashes also means there are no crevices to trap dirt or bacteria.
